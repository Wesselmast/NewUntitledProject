THIS IS THE TODO FILE:
The project will be a game engine.

========================================================================
THESE CHANGES ARE PLANNED FOR THE NEAR-FUTURE:
========================================================================
- Hotloading
  - Having hotloading built in from the start will be useful because I wont have to quit the application every time.
- Input system
  - A decent input system would be very useful. Perhaps just a function call that evaluates an enum
  - is_down(List of Keys)
  - on_keys_down(List of Keys, delegate)
  - on_keys_up(List of Keys, delegate)
- Window resizing
  - And having this work with multiple viewports
- Textures
- Fonts
- Audio
- 3D models
  - I wanna use assimp for this this time
- Decent OpenGL3 
- Extendable editor
  - I want engine tools to be add-ons. You only start with a terminal and a viewport.
- My own GUI system
- Level editor (with gizmos)

========================================================================

The application will be written in a way where nothing will happen if the user doesn't interact with the application.
